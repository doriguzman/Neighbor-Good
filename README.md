# NeighborGood
Helping individuals find their perfect neighborhood.

## About 
 ### The problem
Apartment seekers donâ€™t have access to the tools that will allow them to determine if the neighborhood of their choice fits their lifestyle preferences.

###  The Solution
NeighborGood displays recent 311 complaints on a Google Map so that individuals know what neighborhoods to avoid while seeking apartments in NYC. It allows users to filter by boroughs and different types of 311 complaints (e.g., noise, parking or sanitation complaints)  so that they can find a neighborhood that's suitable for them. 

## Getting started
```
git clone git@github.com:newton-brooks/Neighbor-Good.git

npm install
npm start
```
Open http://localhost:3000/ to view the app in a browser.
